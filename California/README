This directory creates a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable
for inserting the California hybrid Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map.
See the Makefile for specifics of the processing.

To create the necessary files and insert them into the global map, run
make in the Slope directory first, then here you can simply issue the command:

        % make

Following this run, proceed to the PNW directory and follow the directions there.
Note that it is easier to achieve these results from the Makefile in this directory's 
parent directory.
