This directory creates a grid file and a weighted clipping mask suitable
for inserting the Utah geology-based Vs30 map into the global Vs30 map.
See the Makefile for specifics of the processing.

To create the necessary files and insert them into the global map, run
make in the Slope directory first, then in the California directory,
then in the PNW directory, and then here you can simply issue the command:

	% make

Note that it is easier to achieve these results from the Makefile in
this directory's parent directory.
