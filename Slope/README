To make the global slope-based Vs30 map, edit ../Constants.mk then 
simply run make:

	% make

To insert custom maps, follow the instructions in the California 
directory, followed by the other regional directories listed in 
../Makefile. All of this is easier to achieve by running make in 
this directory's parent directory.
